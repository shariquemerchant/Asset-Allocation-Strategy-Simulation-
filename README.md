# Asset Allocation Strategy Simulation

In this project, we generated synthetic datasets to empirically test the performance of multiple asset allocation strategies in terms of several common metrics in the financial market. In particular, we performed ablation studies on some tuning-parameters of those allocation strategies and explore the better ones in different situations. Eventually, conclusions were drawn based on what we observed in our simulation.

The we compared In-sample ratio, Out-of-sample ratio, and Turnover of multiple asset allocation strategies using rolling window technique. And, studied the effect of window length, number of asset and intertemporal correlation along time.
